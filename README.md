# SVG to Gif transformer

A simple webapplication to transform an animated svg to a gif.  

* browse the html file 
* dump your svg description '<svg xmlns=... </svg>' into the textarea
* click the inject button to inject the svg into the document
* tweak the parameter

It has been tested with SMIL.
(maybe not all the SMIL features work though).
